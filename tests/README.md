## Main Simulation

**File:** `building_navigation_sim.py`

This is the **primary simulation** showing realistic agent navigation through a 4-story building.

### Features

✓ Free floor exploration (agent can move anywhere on each floor)
✓ Boundary enforcement (1m wall margin - no escaping!)
✓ Blue line navigation to stairs
✓ Smooth stair climbing between floors
✓ Real-time visualization
✓ Comprehensive verification reports

### Usage

```bash
python building_navigation_sim.py
```

### What You'll See

- **Red agent**: Moving freely on floors
- **Blue agent**: Following path to stairs
- **Orange agent**: Climbing stairs
- Building shown semi-transparent to see inside
- Progress counter and position display
- Green box showing safe navigation area

---

## Generate Buildings

**Before running simulations, generate a building:**

```bash
cd test

# Recommended: Advanced version with realistic geometry
python create_4story_advanced.py

# OR: Basic version (faster, simpler)
python create_4story_building.py

# OR: Use interactive menu
python run_building_generator.py
```

**Output Files:**
- `ai2thor_4story_building.vtk` - For visualization
- `ai2thor_4story_building.stl` - For 3D printing/CAD
- `ai2thor_4story_building.ply` - For point clouds

---

## Testing Suite

### Quick Path Check

```bash
cd test
python test_simple_path.py
```

Shows static path through all floors. Fast verification.

### Animated Navigation

```bash
cd test
python test_floor_connectivity.py
```

Watch agent navigate through building in real-time.

### Structural Analysis

```bash
cd test
python test_wall_floor_separation.py
```

Interactive menu with:
- Floor separation slices
- Wall cross-sections
- Stairwell connectivity analysis

### Run All Tests

```bash
cd test
python run_all_tests.py
```

Master test runner with interactive menu.

## Complete Documentation

For detailed information, see:

📖 **[BUILDING_DOCUMENTATION.md](BUILDING_DOCUMENTATION.md)**

This comprehensive guide includes:
- Installation details
- System architecture
- Customization options
- Troubleshooting
- Bug fixes & improvements
- Advanced topics
- Technical reference

---

## Key Features

### Building Generation
- 4 stacked floors from AI2Thor scenes
- Connected stairwell (2.5m × 4.0m)
- Windows and doors
- Multiple export formats

### Navigation System
- **Free floor movement** - Agent explores entire floor
- **Boundary enforcement** - 1m wall margin
- **Blue line paths** - Floor to stairs
- **Stair climbing** - 12 steps per flight
- **No wall penetration** - All waypoints verified

### Improvements (v2.0)
✓ Fixed: Agent staying within building bounds
✓ Fixed: Free floor exploration (not just 4 points)
✓ Fixed: PyVista has_actor() error
✓ Fixed: Camera orientation (floor 0 at bottom)

---

## Customization

### Change Floors

Edit in any file:
```python
num_floors = 6  # Change from 4
```

### Change Floor Height

```python
floor_height = 3.5  # Change from 3.0m
```

### Change Scene

In `test/create_4story_advanced.py`:
```python
scene_name = 'FloorPlan302'  # Try 301-330
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### No building file found
```bash
cd test
python create_4story_advanced.py
```

### AI2Thor won't start
- Reduce quality from 'Ultra' to 'High'
- Check display settings

### Window won't open
- Try different terminal
- Check OpenGL support

For more solutions, see [BUILDING_DOCUMENTATION.md](BUILDING_DOCUMENTATION.md#troubleshooting)

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- AI2Thor
- PyVista
- NumPy
- Trimesh (optional)

```bash
pip install ai2thor pyvista numpy trimesh
```
